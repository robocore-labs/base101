**An open-source mobile base you can actually build things on.**

Every robot project that has to *move* starts the same way: you want to work on
the interesting part — the arm, the perception, the behaviour — and instead you
spend six weeks building a cart. Then you want to add a lidar, and there's
nowhere to put it. Then you add a compute board, and you're drilling into your
own chassis. Most open mobile bases are somebody's finished robot, published as
if it were a platform, and the moment your payload differs from theirs you're
forking it.

base101 is the other thing: a chassis whose entire job is to carry whatever you
bolt to it. A machined deck with a grid of tapped holes, four direct-drive hub
motors, a lidar and a depth camera already wired into ROS 2, and a one-line
mounting point for the [mod101](https://github.com/robocore-dev/mod101) arm. It
drives, maps and navigates on day one, so the part you actually care about can
start on day two.

- 🧱 **Real frame, not a printed box** — 60×20 aluminum extrusion, PLA-CF printed parts only where they earn their place.
- 🕳️ **A deck you can bolt anything to** — 280×400 mm aluminum plate, 3 mm thick, CNC-machined ORP compatible grid. 
- 💥 **TPU corners** — printed bumpers absorb the collisions you're going to have, and spare your furniture while you tune the planner.
- 🛞 **4WD skid steer on hub motors** — four Waveshare DDSM210 direct-drive hubs. No gearboxes, no belts, nothing to slip: the wheel *is* the motor.
- 💪 **Sized for a 5–8 kg robot** — 97 N of tractive force at stall, enough to push 8 kg up a 10% incline. Arm, battery and compute, and it still clears the threshold into the next room.
- 🛰️ **360° lidar** — RPLidar C1 up front, `/scan` at ~10 Hz into SLAM and Nav2. Mapping and autonomous nav work out of the box.
- 👁️ **Swappable depth camera** — RealSense D435 or Luxonis OAK-D on the same bracket, one launch arg apart. Same topics, same frames.
- 🧠 **One board runs the base** — built around the [link101](https://github.com/robocore-dev/link101-hw)
- 🤖 **Carries the [mod101](https://github.com/robocore-dev/mod101) arm** — one xacro line, plus MoveIt config for the *composed* robot: the arm knows the chassis it stands on.

**Here to build the robot?** The hardware is described below. **Here to run the
code?** Start with [Getting started](#getting-started).

---

## Getting started

You'll need ROS 2 Jazzy on Ubuntu 24.04. Everything else (Gazebo Harmonic,
`ros2_control`, `gz_ros2_control`) comes from apt.

**Just the chassis** — no arm, nothing else to build first:

```bash
cd ~/robots/base101
colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DPython3_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3
source install/setup.bash

ros2 launch base101_bringup_gazebo sim.launch.py
```

That's a robot in Gazebo, driving, scanning, publishing `/odom` — open
`http://localhost:8888/` and drive it around from the browser.

**With the arm**, mod101 has to be built and sourced first (it's the underlay;
base101 sits on top of it):

```bash
cd ~/robots/mod101 && colcon build --symlink-install && source install/setup.bash
cd ~/robots/base101
colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DPython3_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3
source install/setup.bash

ros2 launch base101_bringup_gazebo sim.launch.py arm:=true
```

**This is the only place the build is documented** — everything below assumes
you've run it. Two footnotes that will save you an afternoon:

- **The `Python3_EXECUTABLE` pin isn't arm-specific.** It applies to every build
  here, and it guards against a stray non-system python on `PATH` breaking
  ament's `package.xml` parsing and `rosidl`'s `em` import. Tired of typing it?
  Set it once in `~/.colcon/defaults.yaml` — see [`HARDWARE.md`](HARDWARE.md).
- **`rosdep` has never heard of `mod101_description`.** base101 deliberately
  does not declare it (the arm include sits inside a `<xacro:if>`, so an
  armless workspace never resolves it), but if you run `rosdep install` with
  mod101 present, pass `--skip-keys mod101_description`.

### Things to try

```bash
ros2 launch base101_bringup_gazebo sim.launch.py                    # bare chassis, sticky_floor world
ros2 launch base101_bringup_gazebo sim.launch.py arm:=true          # chassis + 1 mod101 arm
ros2 launch base101_bringup_gazebo sim.launch.py world:=empty.sdf   # pick a world
ros2 launch base101_bringup_gazebo sim.launch.py camera:=oak_d      # Luxonis OAK-D instead of the D435
ros2 launch base101_bringup_gazebo sim.launch.py nav:=false         # no SLAM/Nav2, just the robot
ros2 launch base101_bringup_gazebo sim.launch.py agent:=false       # no robocore agent
ros2 launch base101_bringup_hw     display.launch.py                # rviz only, no sim
```

`camera:=realsense|oak_d` picks which depth module hangs off the front bracket
(default `realsense`). It only swaps the mesh and the simulated FOV — topics
stay `/base_camera/*` and frames stay `camera_link` / `camera_optical_frame`
either way, so nothing downstream notices. Both `sim.launch.py` and
`display.launch.py` take it.

SLAM, Nav2 and the robocore agent all come up with the sim by default
(`nav:=false` / `slam:=false` / `agent:=false` to skip). Nav2 alone is inert —
it blocks in `Activating` until something publishes the `map` frame — so SLAM
and Nav2 start together.

The agent picks its profile from `engine/profiles/` by configuration:
`base101.yaml` armless, `base101_arm.yaml` with `arm:=true`. Override with
`profile:=/path/to.yaml` or `$ROBOCORE_PROFILE`; it serves JSON-RPC on
`ws://:10101` and `/tmp/robocore.sock` (`agent_port:=` / `agent_socket:=`).

Manual test procedures for every variant, tool and launch combination are in
[`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md).

### On the real robot

Motors, IMU and lidar all hang off the Axon 2 board and talk to ROS 2 over
zenoh. `robot.launch.py` owns the whole graph, same shape as `sim.launch.py`
— cmd_vel goes straight from `twist_mux` to the firmware, and `lidar:=`/
`camera:=`/`nav:=`/`slam:=`/`agent:=` all come up from the one launch:

```bash
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_zenoh_cpp
ros2 launch base101_bringup_hw robot.launch.py
```

Firmware, the zenoh router, serial devices, udev rules, and the full
topic/node map (what talks to what, and where odometry gets fused):
[`HARDWARE.md`](HARDWARE.md) — including what's still unresolved about
*how* you get a ROS environment on the robot to run this in, now that forge
(see "Related Projects" below) is deprecated in favor of pixi
([`PIXI.md`](PIXI.md), sim-only for now).

## Adding the mod101 arm

**The whole point of the deck is that something goes on it.** The obvious
something is [mod101](https://github.com/robocore-dev/mod101), a 5+1 DOF arm
that's designed to be embedded — it's a prefix-parameterised xacro macro, so
base101 mounts it with one call and gets joints `arm_1…6`.

```bash
ros2 launch base101_bringup_gazebo sim.launch.py arm:=true                   # jaws gripper
ros2 launch base101_bringup_gazebo sim.launch.py arm:=true arm_tool:=parallel
ros2 launch base101_bringup_hw display.launch.py arm:=true                   # rviz only
```

You don't configure the arm here. Rail lengths, servo mounts and the active
tool all come from `mod101_config.xacro` — whatever mod101's web configurator
last saved. Resize the arm over there, rebuild here, done.

### How the two repos meet

mod101 is an **underlay**: built and sourced first, it puts its packages on
`AMENT_PREFIX_PATH`, and base101 is the overlay on top. **Nothing in mod101
knows base101 exists.** base101 reaches back across the boundary in exactly
three places:

| Crossing | Where, in base101 | What it pulls from mod101 |
|---|---|---|
| **Geometry** | `base101_description/urdf/arm.xacro` | `<xacro:mod101_arm prefix="arm_" parent="top_plate_1">` from `mod101_macro.xacro` |
| **Semantics** | `base101_arm_moveit_config/srdf/base101_arm.srdf.xacro` | `<xacro:mod101_arm_srdf prefix="arm_" tool=…>` from `mod101_moveit_config` |
| **Build args** | both files above | `mod101_config.xacro` — rail lengths, servo mounts, active tool |

Two macro calls and one config file. No forked packages, no vendored meshes, no
duplicated URDF — which is what let the (now parked) dual-arm tower mount the
*same* macro twice, `left_arm_` / `right_arm_`, with zero changes upstream.

Two things worth knowing before they confuse you:

- **Only the `arm` variant crosses over.** The `simple` variant never touches
  the underlay, so a bare-chassis build needs no mod101 at all.
- **The prefix renames everything the macro emits.** `joint_base` becomes
  `arm_joint_base`, and the planning group `arm` becomes **`arm_arm`**. Every
  base101 config keys on the prefixed names. It reads badly and it is correct.

### Motion planning

```bash
ros2 launch base101_bringup_gazebo sim.launch.py arm:=true moveit:=true   # gazebo + move_group
```

This config exists because mod101's own only knows arm-vs-arm collisions — but
the arm can reach every part of the chassis it's bolted to, so the composed
robot needs its own self-collision matrix. The planning scene knows the robot,
not the world; [`docs/obstacle-awareness.md`](docs/obstacle-awareness.md)
covers where perceived obstacles should live relative to a picking layer.

One gotcha: the sim has to run with `arm_control:=moveit` so it spawns
`FollowJointTrajectory` controllers instead of the `Float64MultiArray` ones the
web sliders use — `moveit:=true` forces that for you. Details in
[`base101_arm_moveit_config/README.md`](src/base101_arm/base101_arm_moveit_config/README.md).

**Controllers** — arm and gripper are
`position_controllers/JointGroupPositionController`, commanded with
`std_msgs/Float64MultiArray` on `/<name>/commands`:

| Controller | Joints |
|---|---|
| `arm_controller` | `arm_joint_base, arm_joint_shoulder, arm_joint_elbow, arm_joint_wrist_tilt, arm_joint_wrist_roll` |
| `gripper_controller` | `arm_6` (the tool joint) |
| `diff_drive_controller` | wheels (via `twist_mux`) |

The wrist camera is bridged as `/arm_wrist_camera/image_raw`.

## Driving it from a browser

No joystick, no terminal, no extra install — two ways:

- **rosboard's "Joint sliders" card** (the good one): open
  `http://localhost:8888/`, pick **Joint sliders** in the System nav. One panel,
  a position slider for every controlled joint, initialised from the live robot
  pose with readouts and a re-sync button. Groups whose hardware isn't loaded
  hide themselves, and the card survives a reload. Base driving lives on the
  separate **Teleop** card. (Position commands deliberately *aren't* zeroed by
  the publish watchdog the way Twist is, so the arm holds its pose when the
  browser goes quiet.)
- **`base101_teleop`** — parked in [`attic/`](attic/README.md): its controller
  topics predate the single-arm consolidation and no longer match this
  robot. rosboard's Joint sliders card above is the current fallback.

## Simulation

The robot runs in **Gazebo Sim** through `gz_ros2_control`, and the sim is
meant to be the default place you work — it publishes the same `/cmd_vel_*`,
`/odom`, `/scan`, `/joint_states` and `/base_camera/image_raw` topics the real
robot does, so code written against sim moves over unchanged.

Each variant takes a `simulator` xacro arg (`gazebo` | `none`) that decides
whether the URDF carries the sim `ros2_control` and extension tags; `none` is
the bare URDF for rviz and real hardware. Worlds and the gz↔ros bridge config
live in the shared `base101_worlds` package.

## How the workspace is put together

*Skip this unless you're adding a package — everything above works without it.*

It's a **shared core** plus one self-contained stack per **variant**
(`description` / `gazebo` / `control`). Variants are grouped into folders under
`src/` (`base101/`, `base101_arm/`); colcon discovers packages recursively, so
the folders are purely organisational. Packages parked out of the build live in
[`attic/`](attic/README.md).

**Model, config and worlds** — `src/base101/`

| Package | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `base101_description` | ament_python | **The robot**: `base101.xacro` (one description, `arm:=` picks the configuration), chassis links/joints, sensors, materials, meshes. *Not launched directly.* |
| `base101_control` | ament_cmake | Tuning: `controllers.{sim,hw}.yaml`, `twist_mux.yaml`, and the hardware overlay `base101.hardware.xacro`. |
| `base101_control_plugin` | ament_cmake | `ros2_control` SystemInterface bridging the arm's command/state interfaces to the Axon firmware's (`link101-fw`) per-servo topics (zenoh). Arm-only — locomotion talks to the firmware directly, no `ros2_control` involved. |
| `base101_worlds` | ament_cmake | Sim-common assets: Gazebo worlds, ros↔gz bridge, RViz preset. |

**Stacks** — own their own launch, composed by a bringup package

| Package | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `base101_slam` | ament_cmake | `slam_toolbox`: `/map` and the `map->odom` TF. On hardware, odometry fusion is **not** here — see `base101_control`'s EKF below. |
| `base101_nav` | ament_cmake | Nav2: planner, controller, bt_navigator, velocity smoother, behavior trees. |
| `base101_arm_moveit_config` | ament_cmake | `src/base101_arm/` — MoveIt semantics for the composed chassis+arm robot, and `move_group.launch.py`. |

**Bringup** — the only launches you type

| Package | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `base101_bringup_gazebo` | ament_cmake | `sim.launch.py` — the whole robot in Gazebo: model, controllers, bridges, SLAM, Nav2, optionally arm + MoveIt. |
| `base101_bringup_hw` | ament_cmake | `robot.launch.py` — the whole robot on real hardware, same argument contract as `sim.launch.py`: `robot_state_publisher`, `twist_mux`, the host-side EKF, `rosboard`, lidar, camera, SLAM/Nav2 (`nav:=`/`slam:=`), robocore agent (`agent:=`), and (`arm:=true`) the arm's `controller_manager`. Also owns `display.launch.py` (RViz only). |

Arm or no arm is the `arm:=` argument, not a package. Before the 2026-08
restructure it was six packages (`base101_simple_{description,gazebo,control}`
and `base101_arm_{description,gazebo,control}`) expressing one boolean — see
[`docs/bringup-restructure.md`](docs/bringup-restructure.md). A third bringup
package, `base101_autonomy` (SLAM+Nav2 as their own hardware forge
component), existed briefly and was removed once `base101_bringup_hw` went
back to owning the whole graph directly.

**Other tooling** — `src/`

| Package | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `robocore_agent` | ament_python | Robocore (blueprint engine) agent: ROS interface, task/safety model, Nav2 + SLAM managers, sensor streams. Launched by both bringup packages (`agent:=false` to skip); **not vendored in this workspace** (see `PIXI.md`) — `agent:=true` needs it sourced from elsewhere first. Commands `/cmd_vel_agent` at twist_mux priority 50. |
| `base101_mcp` | ament_python | Generic ROS2 ↔ MCP (Model Context Protocol) bridge. Lets Claude (or any MCP client) discover topics/services and read/publish messages over natural language. Requires `pip install "fastmcp>=2,<3"`. |
| `rosboard` | ament_python | Vendored web dashboard. Carries two publisher cards: **Teleop** (Twist) and **Joint sliders** (Float64MultiArray position commands for the arm). |

`SIM` compose `SLAM`/`NAV` the same way now (`HW` used to hand that off to a
separate `base101_autonomy` forge component; that package is gone, `HW`
composes them directly).
