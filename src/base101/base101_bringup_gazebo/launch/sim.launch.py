"""base101 in Gazebo Sim — the whole robot, one launch.

Replaces base101_simple_gazebo and base101_arm_gazebo, which were ~90%
identical and differed only in whether an arm was on the deck. That is now
the `arm` argument. The argument contract matches base101_bringup_hw's, so
what you type at the sim is what you type at the robot (minus `world` and
`camera`, which only mean something here).

    ros2 launch base101_bringup_gazebo sim.launch.py
    ros2 launch base101_bringup_gazebo sim.launch.py arm:=true
    ros2 launch base101_bringup_gazebo sim.launch.py arm:=true moveit:=true
    ros2 launch base101_bringup_gazebo sim.launch.py nav:=false rosboard:=false
    ros2 launch base101_bringup_gazebo sim.launch.py agent:=false        # no robocore
    ros2 launch base101_bringup_gazebo sim.launch.py world:=empty.sdf rviz:=true

Startup order, which is the whole reason this file is not a flat list:

    gz_sim + robot_state_publisher + bridges     (immediately)
      -> spawn model into the world              (creates controller_manager,
                                                  via the gz_ros2_control
                                                  plugin in base101.xacro)
        -> joint_state_broadcaster
          -> diff_drive_controller [+ arm controllers]
            -> +5 s: slam + nav2 [+ move_group] + robocore agent

The autonomy tail is delayed rather than raced: slam_toolbox wants /scan and
the odom->base_link TF (diff_drive_controller's) before it will build a map.

Nav2 and SLAM are launched together on purpose. Nav2 alone is inert —
planner_server blocks in `Activating` forever waiting for a `map` frame that
only slam publishes, which reads from the outside as "nav doesn't launch".
They remain independent packages with their own lifecycle managers; this
file only decides that they start together.
